    <p>I&#8217;ve been sort of living in Brno for the last 7 years (college included). It&#8217;s quite a hilly city, with lots of cars, very good public transportation system and ever-improving cycling infrastructure. All these years I was using trams, buses and trolleybuses to get myself from one place to&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>These are all great,&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can read while you&nbsp;ride</li>
<li>you are generally faster than car during rush&nbsp;hour</li>
<li>you don&#8217;t waste your time trying to park your&nbsp;car</li>
</ul>
<p>These all suck,&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul>
<li>public transportation is quite expensive in&nbsp;Brno</li>
<li>people stink in&nbsp;summer</li>
<li>some people stink in winter as&nbsp;well</li>
<li>you usually have to change several lines to actually get where you&nbsp;want</li>
<li>they&#8217;re&nbsp;crowded</li>
</ul>
<p>My period card expired on March 8 and I decided not to renew it. Why? See the list above. As I don&#8217;t have a car and I work at the far end of the city, I can either ride a bike or run to work. Ask me how it&#8217;s been for the first month? Not bad at&nbsp;all.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s so great about&nbsp;commuting?</h2>
<p>Not so long ago <em>I considered commuting a waste of time</em>. It took me 40-50 minutes to get to work and about the same to get back home. That&#8217;s 1-2 hours not being productive, not doing anything at all actually, just changing&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a <em>terrible mistake</em> to do. It&#8217;s much better to see this time as an <strong>opportunity</strong> to do that little extra for yourself - walk, run, ride. Even though it takes me a bit longer than public transport (showering and dressing included), it leaves me with totally different state of mind in the end - it just starts me up (hello Rolling&nbsp;Stones).</p>
<p>You can go for a ride right from work. That&#8217;s&nbsp;priceless.</p>
<p>As a by-product I started to care more about what I eat and when I eat it. I actually spend time cooking so I get enough food during the day. Something I didn&#8217;t do before, because you can always buy something sweet before the bus comes,&nbsp;right?</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s not so great about&nbsp;commuting?</h2>
<p><strong>Weather</strong>, especially in spring and autumn, often sucks. Sometimes I come to work soaking wet, nothing a hot shower wouldn&#8217;t fix though. Someone still needs to clean the&nbsp;bike&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic</strong> sucks in the evening. I get up before six, leave home before half past six, thus avoid heavy traffic. Riding a bike home in the evening is threatening sometimes and a bit of mutual respect between pedestrians, cyclists and drivers would&nbsp;do.</p>
<p><strong>Cycling paths</strong> sometimes end right before the big crossroads. Often drivers use parts of the network as parking lanes, which puts you in danger&nbsp;suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>Other cyclists, skaters, people walking their dogs, little kids</strong> usually don&#8217;t care about you at all. You better don&#8217;t get distracted if you want to get home safe and&nbsp;sound.</p>
<p><strong>Books are hard to read</strong> on the&nbsp;bike.</p>
<h2>Does it tell you something about your&nbsp;city?</h2>
<p>I guess the city you see on foot or from atop a saddle is completely different than the one seen from a bus or a&nbsp;car.</p>
<p>Is it rather car or bike friendly? Do you feel at risk riding a bike or running? Is it faster to run/ride or drive? Does your city actually want you to leave your car at home at all, or has it been designed for&nbsp;cars?</p>
<p>River seems to be blessing when your city has one (unless flood strikes, different story). <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/T6wMLSCFzZU2">If done right</a>, its shores might become one of the most beautiful parts of the city. Something Brno needs to catch up with other&nbsp;cities.</p>
<p>I hope one day I&#8217;ll get up and see Brno changing in front of me. <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3058685/paris-is-redesigning-its-major-intersections-for-pedestrians-not-cars">Just like Paris is right now.</a> We all die in the end, so why not to take a walk before we&nbsp;do?</p>
