    <p>I love blogging. I hate blogging systems. I hate content management systems. I just want to blog. That&#8217;s what <a href="http://bolt80.com/piecrust/">PieCrust</a> is all about - it lets you&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>It is powerful static website generator perfect for my needs (and for yours as well?). Blogging with PieCrust is really a piece of&nbsp;cake:</p>
<ol>
<li>prepare&nbsp;post</li>
<li>serve&nbsp;site</li>
<li>bake&nbsp;site</li>
<li>send it off to the&nbsp;public</li>
</ol>
<p>I love having clean <span class="caps">OS</span>. That&#8217;s what <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a> is all about - for me. Running PieCrust on Docker is really easy, it does not clutter your <span class="caps">PC</span> and it just&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>If you ever want to use PieCrust on Docker, why don&#8217;t you start with this code?

<p>Running <code>sudo docker build --tag=piecrust .</code> will result in having docker container ready to run. Just run <code>sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v /host_piecrust_path/:/container_path piecrust /bin/bash</code> in terminal. While in container terminal, run <code>chef serve -n -p 8080 -a 0.0.0.0</code> and visit <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. You should see your PieCrust site up and&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>The last command tells chef to serve your site on port 8080 (which should be free unless you&#8217;re running Tomcat or something like that) and make it listen on every available network interface. If you used 127.0.0.1 instead, you would never reach your site from outside the&nbsp;container.</p>
<p>See?&nbsp;Easy.</p>

</pre></div>


<p>When you call <code>format("DD° MM' SS'  DD° MM' SS'");</code> you&#8217;ll get decimal value in return (or <code>prompt</code> to be accurate). What I like the most about this solution is the usage of Math.pow(). I think it is a neat way to transform the values as you need to divide parts of latitude or longitude by 60<sup>0</sup>, 60<sup>1</sup> and 60<sup>2</sup> respectively.</p>
<p>There is definitely a googol of different solutions to this task, I just liked the simplicity of this&nbsp;one.</p>

    <aside><span>Sep 2, 2014</span>
    <span>    <a class="tag-url" href="https://www.zimmi.cz/posts/tag/geoserver.html">geoserver</a>    </span>
    <span><a class="category-url" href="https://www.zimmi.cz/posts/category/development.html">development</a></span>
    </aside>
    <p>Printing a web map requires a lot more than doing <code>Ctrl + P</code>. <a href="http://mapfish.org/">MapFish</a> seems to be the best option to use with Geoserver, and it comes <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/community/printing/">ready as an extension</a>. If you installed the module properly, you should be seeing general info at <a href="http://localhost:8080/geoserver/pdf/info.json">http://localhost:8080/geoserver/pdf/info.json</a>. You&#8217;ll find a <code>config.yaml</code> in <code>data_dir/printing</code>.</p>

<p>MapFish lets you access three different&nbsp;points:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>info.json</code> that returns current config as defined in config.yaml&nbsp;file</li>
<li><code>print.pdf</code> that actually prints the map as defined in the <code>spec</code> <span class="caps">GET</span>&nbsp;argument</li>
<li><code>create.json</code> that returns a <span class="caps">JSON</span> object with an <span class="caps">URL</span> of the printed&nbsp;map</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, if you&#8217;re displaying a lot of layers in the map and all of them should be printed, you need to pass it as a <span class="caps">POST</span> argument when calling <code>print.pdf</code> or <code>create.json</code>, otherwise you&#8217;ll be getting an error complaining about the <span class="caps">GET</span> request&nbsp;length.</p>

<p>The <code>config.yaml</code> file is where you define settings for the print module. You definitely want to define <code>dpis</code> (we&#8217;re using 90, 200 and 300 <span class="caps">DPI</span>), <code>scales</code> (they probably need to be hardcoded, I didn&#8217;t succeed trying any arbitrary scale) and <code>layouts</code> (we&#8217;re using A4 to A0 both portrait and&nbsp;landscape).</p>

<p>However, defining the page size might get tricky as MapFish does not use standardized sizes defined in cm, in or any other unit. I&#8217;ve experimenting and doing some maths and here&#8217;s what I came up with for portrait&nbsp;layouts.</p>

<table class="table-centered">
    <tr>
        <th>A0</th>
        <th>A1</th>
        <th>A2</th>
        <th>A3</th>
        <th>A4</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2382&times;3361</td>
        <td>1683&times;2380</td>
        <td>1190&times;1680</td>
        <td>840&times;1180</td>
        <td>595&times;832</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><em>The bigger paper you use, the smaller <span class="caps">DPI</span> is available</em>, that&#8217;s what I found out messing around with MapFish settings. This means that we&#8217;re using 200 <span class="caps">DPI</span> top for A2 layout and 90 <span class="caps">DPI</span> for A1 and A0 layout,&nbsp;respectively.</p>

<p>JQuery takes care of sending <span class="caps">POST</span> request and fetching the response. <a href="http://www.edpp.cz/poli_mapa-povodnoveho-planu-mesta/">See it in action</a> (Choose <em>Nástroje</em> and <em>Tisknout</em> for&nbsp;printing).</p>

    <p>I am writing a diploma thesis focused on extracting spatial data from social networks. I have been working mainly with Twitter <span class="caps">API</span> and results I have got so far look really promising. This post was written as a reaction to many retweets I got when I shared one of my visualizations. It aims to make it clear how to connect to Twitter Streaming <span class="caps">API</span> using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and <a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and retrieve tweets to analyze them&nbsp;later.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions after reading this paper, feel free to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/zimmicz">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:zimmicz@gmail.com">e-mail</a>. I must say right here <strong>that the code will be shared as well as the map</strong>, but there are still some bugs/features I would like to&nbsp;remove/add.</p>

<p><small>On a side note: I have been studying cartography and <span class="caps">GIS</span> for the last five years at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic. I am mostly interested in ways computers can make data handling easier. I&nbsp;like to code in Python.</small></p>

<h3>Using Twitter Streaming <span class="caps">API</span></h3>

<p>As you probably know, Twitter offers three different&nbsp;APIs:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> which is obviously RESTful. You can access almost every piece of information on Twitter with this one: tweets, users, places, retweets,&nbsp;followers&#8230;</li>
<li>Search <span class="caps">API</span> used for getting search results. You can customize these by sending parameters with your&nbsp;requests.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming <span class="caps">API</span></strong> which I am going to tell you about. It is really different, as (again, obviously) it keeps streaming tweets from the time you connect to the server. This means, once the connection is made, it has to stay open as long as you want tweets coming to you. The important thing here is that you get real time tweets delivered to you via this <abbr title="Twitter only delivers a sample of tweets, not the whole traffic.">stream</abbr>, which implies you cannot use this <span class="caps">API</span> to get tweets already&nbsp;tweeted.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To sum it up: You get a small sample of tweets in a real time as long as the connection to the server stays&nbsp;open.</strong></p>

<h3>What you&nbsp;need</h3>

<p>To use any of the Twitter APIs, you need to authenticate you (or your app) against Twitter via OAuth protocol. To be able to do so, you need a Twitter account, because only then you can <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">create apps</a>, obtain access tokens and get authenticated for <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;use.</p>

<p>And then, obviously, you need something to connect to server with. I chose <strong>node.js</strong> because it seemed as a good tool to keep connection alive. I have also been interested in this technology for the couple of months but never really had a task to use it&nbsp;for.</p>

<p>The good thing about node.js is that it comes with lots of handy libraries. You get <strong>socket.io</strong> for streaming, <strong>ntwitter</strong> for using Twitter <span class="caps">API</span> and <strong>sqlite3</strong> for working with SQLite&nbsp;databases.</p>

<p>You need something to store the data in also. As mentioned, I picked SQLite for this task. It is lightweight, does not need server nor configuration to run, just what I was looking for. Seems we are set to go,&nbsp;right?</p>

<h3>Filtering the&nbsp;data</h3>

<p>I guess none of you is interested in obtaining random tweets from around the world, neither was I. I live in the Czech republic and that is the area I want to get tweets from.&nbsp;How?</p>

<p>It is fairly simple, you tell Twitter with the <code>locations</code> parameter of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter"><code>statuses/filter</code></a> resource. This parameter specifies a set of bounding boxes to&nbsp;track.</p>

<p><strong>To sum it up: you connect to the server and tell it you just want to get tweets from the area you specified with the <code>locations</code> parameter. The server understands and keeps you&nbsp;posted.</strong></p>

<h4>Is it that&nbsp;simple?</h4>

<p>No. Twitter decides whether to post you the tweet or not according to what the value of coordinates field is. It goes like&nbsp;this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the <code>coordinates</code> field is not empty, it gets tested against the bounding box. If it matches, it is sent to the&nbsp;stream.</li>
<li>If the <code>coordinates</code> field is empty, but the <code>place</code> field is not, it is the <code>place</code> field that gets checked. If if it by any extent intersects the bounding box, it is sent to the&nbsp;stream.</li>
<li>If both of the fields are empty, nothing is&nbsp;sent.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to throw away the tweets with the empty <code>coordinates</code> field, because the accuracy of the value specified in the place field can be generally considered very low and insufficient for my purposes. You still need to account for position inaccuracies of users&#8217; devices though, however that is not something that we can deal with. <em>Let us just assume that geotagged tweets are&nbsp;accurate.</em></p>

<div class="text-center"><img data-echo="/posts/assets/analyzing-twitter-languages-with-streaming-api/cr.png" width="50%" height="50%" title="Geotagged tweets" class="img-rounded"><p><strong>Figure:</strong> Twitter seems not to be very accurate when matching tweets against bounding&nbsp;box.</p></div>

<p>Although, as you can see in the picture, they are not. Or they are, but Twitter is not good at telling so. Besides that, none of the countries in the world is shaped like a rectangle and we would need to clip the data anyway. That is where SQLite comes in, because I have been saving incoming tweets right into the&nbsp;database.</p>

<p>If you use any <span class="caps">GUI</span> manager (sqlitebrowser for Linux is just fine), you can easily export your data to the <span class="caps">CSV</span> file, load it into <span class="caps">QGIS</span>, clip it with Natural Earth countries shapefile and save them to the GeoJSON file. It is just a matter of few JavaScript lines of code to put GeoJSON on a Leaflet&nbsp;map.</p>

<h3>Displaying the&nbsp;data</h3>

<p>Once a GeoJSON file is ready, it can be used for making an appealing viz to get a sense of what may be called &#8220;nationalities spatial patterns&#8221;. The <code>lang</code> field (stored in the database, remember?) of every tweet is used to colour the marker accordingly. Its value represents a two-letter language code as specified in <span class="caps">ISO</span> 639-1&nbsp;document.</p>

<p>However, as those codes are guessed by Twitter&#8217;s language algorithms, they are prone to error. There are actually three scenarios we might be&nbsp;facing:</p>

<ol>
<li>User tweets in the same language as used in the Twitter&nbsp;account.</li>
<li>User tweets in his/her mother language, but has set different Twitter account&nbsp;language.</li>
<li>User does not tweet in his/her mother language, but has it set as a Twitter account&nbsp;language.</li>
</ol>

<p>We basically have to deal with 2) and 3), because 1) means we can be pretty sure what nationality the user is. Sadly though, I have not found an easy way to tell which one of these two we came across, thus which language settings should be prioritized. I made an arbitrary decision to prioritize the language the tweet was written in, based on assumption that <strong>the most of the users tweet in their mother language</strong>. No matter what you do, the data is still going to be biased by automatically generated tweets, especially ones sent by Foursquare saying &#8220;I&#8217;m at @WhateverBarItIs (http://someurl.co)&#8221;. It works fine for the strange languages like Russian and Arabic&nbsp;though.</p>

<p>From Jan 2 to Jan 4 this year 5,090 tweets were collected. Leaflet is becoming a little sluggish without clustering turned on displaying all of them. Plans are to let the collection run until Jan 7 and then put all the tweets on the map. I guess that might be around 10,000 geotagged tweets by that&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>I am definitely willing to share the <abbr title="Do not expect much, it was my first time with node.js">code</abbr> and the final viz. Meanwhile, you can have a look at the screenshot on picture [*]. I have already implemented nationality switch (legend items are clickable) and I would like to add a day/night switch to see whether there are any differences between the peoples&#8217;&nbsp;behaviour. </p>

A legend is used to turn nationalities on and off. You are looking at Prague by the&nbsp;way.</p></div>

<p>Obviously the most tweets were sent from the most populated places, e.g. Prague, Brno,&nbsp;Ostrava. </p>
