    <p>I&#8217;ve been in love with Leaflet ever since v0.4 was released. Well-documented, clean <span class="caps">API</span> included, beautiful controls and tons of plugins makes it my number one choice to create a web map. I wrote a Google Maps <span class="caps">API</span> app used at edpp.cz a year and a half ago and I&#8217;ve been thinking of refactoring it since then. I don&#8217;t think I even knew Leaflet existed back in those&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>I used to use Google Maps as my primary tool for web maps, it used to be the only choice back then. OpenLayers <span class="caps">API</span> documentation was one of the worst docs I have ever read (<em>alphabetic sorting, please!</em>), thus making it a no-go for me. It looked ugly and was sort of overwhelmed with functions. Leaflet came out completely different and I decided to rewrite our main map app using this great open-source&nbsp;library.</p>

<h3>My first&nbsp;control</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/leaflet-chmi-radar-control/google_maps.png" title="Google maps layer control" class="left">Modularity is one of the things I like the most about Leaflet. I was struggling with creating checkboxes used to toggle layers in Google Maps app, it comes ready with Leaflet. Adding a control to the map is easy as piece of cake, you do <a href="http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#icontrol"><code>L.Control.extend({)}</code></a> and that&#8217;s it (almost). Since the map displays animated radar images showing the precipitation that occurred during last three hours or so I thought it would be great implementing this as a control: a button used to toggle the animation on/off and displaying the time currently shown image was created&nbsp;at.</p>

<p>The image on the left side displays the old solution using Google Maps. It was using a lot of <span class="caps">DOM</span> manipulation, was quite hard to maintain and definitely not eye-candy. When the animation was turned on, another control popped up in the map&#8217;s top left corner displaying the time the image was taken at. The animation toggle (<em>srážkový radar</em>) was incorporated into the layer control. I decided to take it out and make it a separate feature of the&nbsp;map.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/leaflet-chmi-radar-control/control.png" title="Leaflet radar control" class="right">You can see the result in the image below. The control is a simple button with the radar icon displaying the time when active. It is only useful for the Czech Republic and is highly dependent on the image provider (<abbr title="Czech Hydrometeorogical Institute"><span class="caps">CHMI</span></abbr>), which means that if the <span class="caps">URL</span> of the images was to be changed, the whole control would&nbsp;break.</p>

<p>You can<a href="/assets/leaflet-chmi-radar-control/radarcontrol.zip"> grab the code if you like</a>. You add the control to the map as any other&nbsp;control:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">radar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">L</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Control</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Radar</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">radar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can set the control visibility with <code>visible</code> property passed into <code>options</code> of the&nbsp;control.</p>
