If you ever find yourself in need to use custom projection with Leaflet, feel free to start with this example of [Czech national coordinate system](https://github.com/zimmicz/leaflet-custom-crs-jtsk). All you need is [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), [proj4.js](http://proj4js.org/) and [proj4 for Leaflet plugin](https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet). I'm still not sure how `origin` coordinates work though.
