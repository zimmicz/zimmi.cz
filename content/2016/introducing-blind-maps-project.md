I'd like to introduce you to my little pet project, which might just as well be awarded _the first pet project I've ever completed_, called [Blind maps](https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps).

It's a very simple, yet useful web application built on top of the great [Leaflet](../../tag/leaflet.html) library meant to help you get to know our world a bit better. As the name suggests, the app shows you, well&hellip; a blind map, and you try to fill as many features as you can.

The app is ready and can be used:

* online at [Blind maps](https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/) with the map of your choice (if available)
* offline, downloaded to your computer and filled with whatever data you want

What I find great about this project is the ease of adding new dataset. For starters, I filled it with data coming from [Natural Earth](naturalearthdata.com):

* CONUS states
* European states
* World capitals

If you wish, feel free to send me a pull request with GeoJSON data, I'll be happy to have more datasets available! The process is described at the [project homepage](https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps).

As you notice at the project homepage, there are two versions of the game available:

* one lets you find map features by their names
* the other one lets you type name highlighted feature (much tougher)

Have fun!
